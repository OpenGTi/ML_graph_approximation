# Technical Papers Repository

This repository contains the technical paper titled "Machine Learning Approach for Approximating Design Parameters from Engineering Graphs" published in Tetra Tech Coffey East Coast Symposium 2025.

## Folder Structure
- **[ML_Engineering_Graphs]**: This folder contains python codes that derive the required polynomials and non-linear functions, raw data and trained machine learning models.
  
## Contents
- **Raw Data**: The subfolder "datafiles" contains extarcted data points for Case 1 and Case 2 using WebPlotDigitizer. 
- **Python Codes**: There are several python files.  They are used for performing non-linear regression, polynomial regression, Gausssian Process Regression and Fully Connected Neural Network and plotting 3D graphs.
- **Models**: The trained GPR and FCNN models are saved as .joblib and .h5 format.
- **Excel Spreadsheets**: The Excel file "Examples" contains simple python codes.  Readers may follow the instructions in the file to load the trained models and make predictions in Excel.  
- **Additional Resources**: NA
